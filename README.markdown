# OpenVox Docs

Source for the OpenVox documentation site, along with an issue tracker for
reporting problems with the published docs.

## Getting started

To build the documentation in this repository, first install Ruby 3.2 or later.
Then use Bundler to install the project dependencies:

```console
bundle install
```

Then build the documentation with:

```console
bundle exec jekyll build
```

Or serve it locally to preview in a browser:

```console
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Updating documentation

This section describes common workflows for updating the docs.
If you are considering a change not described here, or need help,
please chat with us in `#sig-documentation` on the
[Vox Pupuli Slack][vox-slack] (bridged to `#voxpupuli-sig-documentation`
on [Libera.Chat][libera-chat] for IRC users).

[vox-slack]: https://short.voxpupu.li/puppetcommunity_slack_signup
[libera-chat]: https://libera.chat/

The source files for docs pages can be found under the `docs/` directory.
This directory contains versioned subfolders for each project, which
then contain the Markdown files that make up documentation for that
project.

Whichever workflow you follow, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to review
your changes locally before opening a pull request.

### Adding a new page

Create a new Markdown file in the product's directory under `docs/` (such as
`docs/_openvox/`), and then add a link to it in the product's nav file under
`_data/nav/`. The page appears in every version of the product; see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#editing-versioned-pages) for version-specific
pages.

### Adding a new project

Add the project to `_data/products.yml`, create its pages under `docs/` and a
nav file under `_data/nav/`, and add it to the product bar in
`_data/navigation.yml`. The build registers its collections from
`_data/products.yml`; see [MAINTAINING.md](MAINTAINING.md).

Consider updating `index.md` to add an entry pointing to your new content.
See the [home layout reference][home-layout] for details.

### Modifying theme settings

This project uses the [Jekyll VitePress theme][jekyll-vitepress], by
[@crmne](https://github.com/crmne). Many aspects of the theme can be
customized or overridden, see the theme documentation for details.
