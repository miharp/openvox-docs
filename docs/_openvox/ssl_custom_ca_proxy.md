title: "SSL configuration: Adding a custom CA for HTTPS-inspecting proxies"
---

Some network environments use HTTPS-inspecting proxies (such as Squid with SSL Bump) that
re-sign outbound TLS connections using a local CA. OpenVox's Ruby runtime uses its own
bundled CA certificate store rather than the system trust store, so the proxy CA must be
added explicitly before OpenVox will trust connections the proxy intercepts.

Common symptoms: `gem install` or module downloads (`puppet module install`) fail with
certificate verification errors even though the system CA trust store already includes the
proxy CA.

## How OpenVox validates outbound TLS

OpenVox ships its own Ruby runtime with a vendored CA bundle compiled in at
`/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/cert.pem`. This path is OpenVox's `OpenSSL::X509::DEFAULT_CERT_FILE`
and is what Ruby uses — not the OS trust store — when validating TLS certificates for
outbound connections such as gem downloads and `puppet module install`.

## Quick fix: add the CA to the `certs/` directory

Copy your proxy CA into OpenVox's `certs/` directory and run `openssl rehash` to generate
the fingerprint symlinks that OpenSSL uses to look up certificates:

```console
cp /path/to/proxy-ca.pem /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/proxy-ca.pem
/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/openssl rehash /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/
```

This directory is OpenVox Ruby's `DEFAULT_CERT_DIR` and is included by `set_default_paths`
on every connection. The directory is empty by default — the `openvox-agent` package does
not place any files there — so user-added files survive package upgrades.

> **Note:** `openssl rehash` is not supported on Windows as of OpenVox 8. Use the
> `SSL_CERT_FILE` approach below on Windows nodes.

If you prefer a one-liner that skips rehash, appending directly to `cert.pem` also works,
but that file is replaced on upgrade:

```console
cat /path/to/proxy-ca.pem >> /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/cert.pem
```

## Persistent fix: `ssl_trust_store` (module downloads only)

For `puppet module install` and https file sources, the cleanest option is the
`ssl_trust_store` setting in `puppet.conf`. OpenVox loads this file as an additional trust
store on top of the built-in bundle, so your proxy CA survives upgrades and no environment
variables are required:

```console
puppet config set ssl_trust_store /etc/ssl/certs/proxy-ca.pem
```

**Important:** `ssl_trust_store` only applies to Puppet's own outbound HTTPS requests. It
does not affect gem installs performed via the `puppet_gem` package provider, because those
run `gem` as a subprocess that does not read `puppet.conf`. Use the `SSL_CERT_FILE` approach
below if you also need gem installs to work.

## Persistent fix: `SSL_CERT_FILE` pointing at a merged bundle

The `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable overrides OpenSSL's default cert path and works
for both `puppet module install` and gem installs. Create a merged bundle that combines the
original Mozilla certs with your proxy CA:

```console
cat /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/cert.pem /path/to/proxy-ca.pem \
  > /etc/ssl/certs/puppet-custom-bundle.pem
```

**Make it permanent for the OpenVox agent service** by adding the variable to the service
environment. On systemd systems, create a drop-in:

```console
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/puppet.service.d
cat > /etc/systemd/system/puppet.service.d/ssl_cert_file.conf <<'EOF'
[Service]
Environment=SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/puppet-custom-bundle.pem
EOF
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart puppet
```

For one-off commands, export the variable in the same shell:

```console
SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/puppet-custom-bundle.pem puppet agent -t
```

## Managing with Puppet

Deploy the CA with a `file` resource and trigger `openssl rehash` on change:

```puppet
file { '/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/proxy-ca.pem':
  ensure  => file,
  owner   => 'root',
  group   => 'root',
  mode    => '0644',
  content => lookup('profile::proxy_ca_cert'),
  notify  => Exec['rehash-puppet-ssl-certs'],
}

exec { 'rehash-puppet-ssl-certs':
  command     => '/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/openssl rehash /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/',
  refreshonly => true,
}
```

Store the proxy CA certificate as a multiline string in Hiera:

```yaml
profile::proxy_ca_cert: |
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

If the certificate is already deployed on the node at a known path (for example, by the
[puppet/trusted_ca](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/trusted_ca) module into the OS
trust store), use a symlink instead to avoid keeping a second copy:

```puppet
file { '/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/proxy-ca.pem':
  ensure => link,
  target => '/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/proxy-ca.pem',
  notify => Exec['rehash-puppet-ssl-certs'],
}

exec { 'rehash-puppet-ssl-certs':
  command     => '/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/openssl rehash /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/',
  refreshonly => true,
}
```


## Verifying the configuration

Confirm Ruby can reach an intercepted host:

```console
/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/ruby -rnet/http -ruri \
  -e 'Net::HTTP.get(URI("https://forgeapi.puppet.com")); puts "OK"'
```

A successful response prints `OK`. A certificate verification error means the proxy CA is
still not trusted by OpenVox's Ruby environment.
