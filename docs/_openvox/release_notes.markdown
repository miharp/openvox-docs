OpenVox's version numbers follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) schema, which splits a version into three segments: Major.Minor.Patch

- Minor: can increase for backward-compatible new functionality or significant bug fixes
- Patch: can increase for bug fixes

## If you're upgrading from Puppet Open Source

Puppet Open Source is no longer actively developed.

You can either upgrade to Puppet 7 and then switch to OpenVox 7 and then upgrade through OpenVox 8 to OpenVox 9, or you can upgrade to Puppet 8 and then migrate to OpenVox 8 and then to OpenVox 9.

## OpenVox 9.0.0-rc1

Released September 4, 2026.

This is the first release candidate for OpenVox 9. It is still a **prerelease** and not yet the stable release. It includes breaking changes; see the [project's github release page](https://github.com/OpenVoxProject/openvox/releases/tag/9.0.0-rc1) for the full list of changes.

Notable breaking changes in this build:

- Running as root without a [`server` setting](configuration.html#server) is now an error instead of a deprecation warning. OpenVox 9 does not default to `server=puppet`, so set the server explicitly in `puppet.conf`.
- The systemd service provider no longer falls back to `invoke-rc.d` and init script inspection on Debian to decide whether a service is enabled.
- The `openvox` gem now ships platform-specific builds for `universal-darwin` and `x64-mingw-ucrt` alongside the generic gem. The legacy `x64-mingw32` and 32-bit `x86-mingw32` gem platforms have been dropped.
