[Resources][], [classes][], and [defined type instances][defined] can have any number of **tags** associated
with them, plus they receive some tags automatically. Tags are useful for:

* [Collecting][collectors] resources
* Analyzing [reports][]
* Restricting catalog runs

## Tag names

[See the reserved words page for the characters allowed in tag names.][tagnames]

## Assigning tags to resources

A resource can have any number of tags. There are several ways to assign a tag to a resource.

### Automatic tagging

Every resource automatically receives the following tags:

* Its resource type
* The full name of the [class][classes] and/or [defined type][defined] in which the resource was declared
* Every [namespace segment][namespace] of the resource's class and/or defined type

For example, a file resource in class `apache::ssl` would get the tags `file`, `apache::ssl`, `apache`,
and `ssl`.

### Containment

Like [relationships][] and most metaparameters, tags are passed along by [containment][]. This means a
resource will receive all of the tags from the class and/or defined type that contains it. In the case of
nested containment (e.g. a class that declares a defined resource, or a defined type that declares other
defined resources), a resource will receive tags from all of its containers.

### The `tag` metaparameter

You can use [the `tag` metaparameter][tagmeta] in a resource declaration to add any number of tags:

```puppet
apache::vhost { 'docs.example.com':
  port => 80,
  tag  => ['us_mirror1', 'us_mirror2'],
}
```

The `tag` metaparameter can accept a single tag or an array. These will be added to the tags the resource
already has. Since [containment][] applies to tags, the example above would assign the `us_mirror1` and
`us_mirror2` tags to every resource contained by `Apache::Vhost['docs.example.com']`.

### The `tag` function

You can use [the `tag` function][tagfunction] inside a class definition or defined type to assign tags to
the surrounding container and all of the resources it contains:

```puppet
class role::public_web {
  tag 'us_mirror1', 'us_mirror2'

  apache::vhost { 'docs.example.com':
    port => 80,
  }
  ssh::allowgroup { 'www-data': }
  @@nagios::website { 'docs.example.com': }
}
```

The example above assigns `us_mirror1` and `us_mirror2` to all resources declared in `role::public_web`,
as well as to all the resources each of them contains.

## Using tags

### Collecting resources

Tags can be used as an attribute in the [search expression][collector_search] of a [resource
collector][collectors]. This is mostly useful for realizing [virtual][] and [exported][] resources.

### Restricting catalog runs

OpenVox agent and `puppet apply` can use [the `tags` setting][tags_setting] to only apply a subset of the
node's [catalog][]. This is useful when refactoring modules and allows you to only apply a single class on
a test node.

The `tags` setting can be set in `puppet.conf` (to permanently restrict the catalog) or on the command
line (to temporarily restrict it):

```bash
sudo puppet agent --test --tags apache,us_mirror1
```

The value of the `tags` setting should be a comma-separated list of tags with no spaces between tags.

### Reading tags in custom report handlers

Resource tags are available to custom report handlers and out-of-band report processors: each
`Puppet::Resource::Status` object and `Puppet::Util::Log` object has a `tags` key whose value is an array
containing every tag for the resource in question. See the following pages for more info:

* [Processing Reports][reports]
* [Report Format][report_format]
