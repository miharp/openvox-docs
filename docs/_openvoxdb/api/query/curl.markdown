You can use [`curl`][curl] to directly interact with OpenVoxDB's REST API. This is useful for testing, prototyping, and quickly fetching arbitrary data.

The instructions below are simplified. For full usage details, see [the curl man page][curl]. For additional examples, please see the user guides for the individual [query REST endpoints][entities], or the other REST API services available.

## Using `curl` From `localhost` (non-SSL/HTTP)

With its default settings, OpenVoxDB accepts unsecured HTTP connections at port 8080 on `localhost`. This allows you to SSH into the OpenVoxDB server and run curl commands without specifying certificate information:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/pdb/query/v4/nodes
```

If you have allowed unsecured access to other hosts in order to [monitor the dashboard][dashboard], these hosts can also use plain HTTP curl commands.

## Using `curl` from remote hosts (SSL/HTTPS)

### Using a certificate/private key pair

To make secured requests from other hosts, you will need to supply the following
via the command line:

* Your site's CA certificate (`--cacert`)
* An SSL certificate signed by your site's Puppet CA (`--cert`)
* The private key for that certificate (`--key`)

Any node managed by Puppet agent will already have all of these, and you can
reuse them for contacting OpenVoxDB. You can also generate a new cert on the CA
Puppet Server with the `puppetserver ca generate` command.

> **Note:** If you have turned on [certificate allowlisting][allowlist], you must
make sure to authorize the certificate you are using:
>
> ```console
> curl 'https://<your.puppetdb.server>:8081/pdb/query/v4/nodes' \
>   --tlsv1 \
>   --cacert /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem \
>   --cert /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/<node>.pem \
>   --key /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/private_keys/<node>.pem
> ```

### Locating Puppet certificate files

Locate Puppet's `ssldir` as follows:

```console
sudo puppet config print ssldir
```

Within this directory:

* The CA certificate is found at `certs/ca.pem`
* The corresponding private key is found at `private_keys/<name>.pem`
* Other certificates are found at `certs/<name>.pem`

## Dealing with complex query strings

Many query strings will contain characters like `[` and `]`, which must be URL-encoded. To handle this, you can use `curl`'s `--data-urlencode` option.

If you do this with an endpoint that accepts `GET` requests, **you must also use the `-G` or `--get` option.** This is because `curl` defaults to `POST` requests when the `--data-urlencode` option is present.

```console
curl -G http://localhost:8080/pdb/query/v4/nodes \
  --data-urlencode 'query=["=", "node_state", "active"]'
```

## Pretty querying of OpenVoxDB

OpenVoxDB returns unprettified JSON by default. OpenVoxDB provides the option of
prettifying your JSON responses with the `pretty` parameter. This parameter
accepts a Boolean value (`true` or `false`) to indicate whether the response
should be pretty-printed. Note that pretty printing comes at the cost of
performance on some of our endpoints, such as `/v4/catalogs`, `/v4/reports` and
`/v4/factsets`, due to the storage of some of their data as JSON/JSONB in PostgreSQL.

```console
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/pdb/query/v4/nodes \
    --data-urlencode 'pretty=true'
```

## Querying OpenVoxDB with POST

OpenVoxDB supports querying by POST, which is useful for large
queries (exact limits depend on the client and webserver used). POST queries allow you to limit the number of entries in the response. The example below limits the query to return one entry.

POST queries use the following syntax:

```console
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/pdb/query/v4/nodes \
  -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \
  -d '{"query":["~","certname",".*.com"],"order_by":[{"field":"certname"}],"limit":1}'
```

## Querying OpenVoxDB based on specific resource attributes

You can use POST to query for a specific resource attribute. Note that this
requires you to escape your quotes (`"`). Alternatively, use the [OpenVoxDB
CLI][pdb-cli], together with the [Puppet Query Language (PQL)][pql] to make
queries without having to escape characters.

To query for the following resource attributes:

```text
resources {
  tag = "foo" and
  exported = true
} 
```

Use the following CURL command:

```console
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/pdb/query/v4 \
  -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "resources { tag = \"foo\" and exported = true }"}'
```
