# Installing OpenVoxDB via Puppet module

[module]: https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/openvoxdb
[config_with_module]: ./configure.html#playing-nice-with-the-openvoxdb-module

You can install and configure all of OpenVoxDB's components and prerequisites (including OpenVoxDB itself, PostgreSQL, firewall rules on RedHat-like systems, and the OpenVoxDB-termini for your Puppet Server) using
[the OpenVoxDB module][module] from the Puppet Forge.

- If you are **already familiar with Puppet** and have a working Puppet deployment, this is the easiest method for installing OpenVoxDB. In this guide, we expect that you already know how to assign Puppet
  classes to nodes.
- If you are **just getting started with Puppet,** you may find it easier to follow our guide to [installing OpenVoxDB from packages](./install_from_packages.html).

## Step 1: Enable the Puppet Platform package repository

If you haven't done so already, you will need to do **one** of the following:

- [Enable the Puppet Platform package repository][package_repos] on your OpenVoxDB server and Puppet Server.
- If you don't use the Puppet Platform repository, make the OpenVoxDB and OpenVoxDB-terminus packages available via your alternate installation strategy. For the module install to succeed a command like
  `yum install puppetdb`, or the equivalent one that uses your system's package manager, needs to be able to succeed.

## Step 2: Assign classes to nodes

Using the normal methods for your site, assign the OpenVoxDB module's classes to your servers. You have three main options for deploying OpenVoxDB:

- If you are installing OpenVoxDB on the same server as your Puppet Server, assign the `openvoxdb` and `openvoxdb::master::config` classes to it.
- If you want to run OpenVoxDB on its own server with a local PostgreSQL instance, assign the `openvoxdb` class to it, and assign the `openvoxdb::master::config` class to your Puppet Server. Make sure to set the
  class parameters as necessary.
- If you want OpenVoxDB and PostgreSQL to each run on their own servers, assign the `openvoxdb::server` class and the `openvoxdb::database::postgresql` classes to different servers, and the
  `openvoxdb::master::config` class to your Puppet Server. Make sure to set the class parameters as necessary. You should also then enable an SSL connection between your PostgreSQL and OpenVoxDB's servers, see
  [the module documentation for how to configure SSL](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/openvoxdb#enable-ssl-connections). This configuration will use the Puppet Agent certificates on both machines to
  authenticate and encrypt the database communication.

Note: By default, the module sets up the OpenVoxDB dashboard to be accessible only via `localhost`. If you'd like to allow access to the OpenVoxDB dashboard via an external network interface, set the
`listen_address` parameter on either of the `openvoxdb` or `openvoxdb::server` classes as follows:

    class { 'openvoxdb':
        listen_address => 'example.foo.com'
    }

These classes automatically configure most aspects of OpenVoxDB. If you need to adjust additional settings (to change the `node_ttl`, for example), see [the "Playing nice with the OpenVoxDB module"
section][config_with_module] of the "Configuring OpenVoxDB" page.

For full details on how to use the module, see the [OpenVoxDB module documentation][module] on Puppet Forge. The module also includes some sample manifests in the `tests` directory that demonstrate its basic
usage.
