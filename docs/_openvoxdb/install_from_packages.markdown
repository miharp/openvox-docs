This page describes how to manually install and configure OpenVoxDB from the official packages. Users are encouraged to install OpenVoxDB via the [OpenVoxDB module][module] instead of installing the packages
directly. Using the module for setting up OpenVoxDB is much easier and less error prone. See [Installing OpenVoxDB via Puppet module][install_module] for more info.

Additionally, these instructions may be useful for understanding OpenVoxDB's various moving parts, and can be helpful if you need to create your own OpenVoxDB module.

> **Notes:**
>
> - After following these instructions, you must [connect your Puppet Server(s) to OpenVoxDB][connect_server]. (If you use a standalone Puppet deployment, you will need to [connect every node to
>   OpenVoxDB][connect_apply].)
> - These instructions are for [platforms with official OpenVoxDB packages][requirements]. To install on other systems, follow [our instructions for installing from source](./install_from_source.html).
> - If this is a production deployment, [review the scaling recommendations](./scaling_recommendations.html) before installing. You should ensure that your OpenVoxDB server will be able to comfortably handle
>   your site's load.

## Step 1: Install and configure Puppet

If Puppet isn't fully installed and configured on your OpenVoxDB server, [install it][installpuppet] and request/sign/retrieve a certificate for the node.

[installpuppet]: /openvox/latest/install_pre.html

Your OpenVoxDB server should be running Puppet agent and have a signed certificate from your Puppet Server. If you run `puppet agent --test`, it should successfully complete a run, ending with
`Notice: Applied catalog in X.XX seconds`.

> Note: If Puppet doesn't have a valid certificate when OpenVoxDB is installed, you will have to [run the SSL config script and edit the config file][ssl_script], or [manually configure OpenVoxDB's SSL
> credentials][postgres_ssl] before the Puppet Server will be able to connect to OpenVoxDB.

## Step 2: Enable the Puppet Platform package repository

If you didn't already use it to install Puppet, you will need to [enable the Puppet Platform package repository][package_repos].

## Step 3: Install OpenVoxDB

Use Puppet to install OpenVoxDB:

    sudo puppet resource package openvoxdb ensure=latest

## Step 4: Configure database

- [Set up a PostgreSQL server and configure OpenVoxDB to use it][configure_postgres]. If your PostgreSQL node is on a separate server than OpenVoxDB, you should [configure an SSL connection][postgres_ssl],
  otherwise your database communication will happen in plaintext over the network. This can be made much simpler by installing using the [OpenVoxDB module][module].

## Step 5: Start the OpenVoxDB service

Use Puppet to start the OpenVoxDB service and enable it on startup.

    sudo puppet resource service puppetdb ensure=running enable=true

You must also configure your OpenVoxDB server's firewall to accept incoming connections on port 8081.

> OpenVoxDB is now fully functional and ready to receive facts, catalogs, and reports from any number of Puppet Servers.

## Finish: Connect Puppet to OpenVoxDB

[You should now configure your Puppet Server(s) to connect to OpenVoxDB][connect_server].

If you use a standalone Puppet site, [you should configure every node to connect to OpenVoxDB][connect_apply].

## Troubleshooting installation problems

- Check the log file (`/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetdb/puppetdb.log`), and see whether OpenVoxDB knows what the problem is.
- If OpenVoxDB is running but the Puppet Server can't reach it, check [OpenVoxDB's `[jetty]` configuration][configure_jetty] to see which port(s) it is listening on, then attempt to reach it by Telnet
  (`telnet <HOST> <PORT>`) from the Puppet Server. If you can't connect, the firewall may be blocking connections. If you can, Puppet may be attempting to use the wrong port, or OpenVoxDB's keystore may be
  misconfigured (see below).
- Check whether any other service is using OpenVoxDB's port and interfering with traffic.
- Check [OpenVoxDB's `[jetty]` configuration][configure_jetty] and the `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetdb/ssl` directory, and make sure it has the necesary SSL files created. If it didn't create these during
  installation, you will need to [run the SSL config script and edit the config file][ssl_script] before a Puppet Server can contact OpenVoxDB.
