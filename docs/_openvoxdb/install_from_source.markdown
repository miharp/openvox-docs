This page describes how to install OpenVoxDB from source code, and how to run OpenVoxDB directly from source without installing.

If possible, we recommend installing OpenVoxDB [with the puppet-openvoxdb module][module] or [from packages][packages]; either approach will be easier than installing from source. However, if you are testing
a new version, developing OpenVoxDB, or installing it on a system not supported with official packages, you will need to install OpenVoxDB from source.

## Step 1: Installation prerequisites

Use your system's package tools to ensure that the following prerequisites are installed:

- (Optional) OpenVox Server 8.x or newer
- A working OpenVox agent or server setup (for ssl-setup to succeed)
- JDK 21 or newer
- [Leiningen][]
- Git (for checking out the source code)

## Step 2, option A: Install from source

Install Leiningen:

    $ mkdir ~/bin && cd ~/bin
    $ curl -L 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein' -o lein --tlsv1
    $ chmod ugo+x lein
    $ ./lein
    # symlink lein to somewhere in your $PATH
    $ sudo ln -s /full/path/to/bin/lein /usr/local/bin

Run the following commands to build a distribution tarball from source:

    mkdir -p ~/git && cd ~/git
    git clone git://github.com/OpenVoxProject/openvoxdb
    git checkout stable    # Or a particular tag you wish to install
    cd openvoxdb
    lein install
    lein with-profile ezbake ezbake stage
    cd target/staging
    rake package:bootstrap
    rake package:tar

Now unpack the tarball to prepare for installation:

    cd pkg
    tar -xzf openvoxdb-*.tar.gz
    cd openvoxdb-*

To perform a full installation of the service and the OpenVoxDB-termini code (usually the best choice when running OpenVoxDB on the same host as the Puppet Server):

    sudo bash install.sh all

Otherwise, for service only:

    sudo bash install.sh service

Or for terminus code only:

    sudo bash install.sh termini

## Step 2, option B: Run directly from source

While installing from source is useful for simply running a development version for testing, for development it's better to be able to run **directly** from source, without any installation step.

Run the following commands:

    $ mkdir -p ~/git && cd ~/git
    $ git clone git://github.com/OpenVoxProject/openvoxdb
    $ cd openvoxdb

    # Download the dependencies
    $ lein deps

This will let you develop on OpenVoxDB and see your changes by simply editing the code and restarting the server. It will not create an init script or default configuration directory. To start the OpenVoxDB
service when running from source, you will need to run the following:

    lein run services -c /path/to/config.ini

A sample config file is provided in the root of the source repo: `config.sample.ini`. You can also provide a conf.d-style directory instead of a flat config file.

Next, you will need to [setup some test users][running_tests] to run the tests locally

## Step 3: Configure a database

In most cases you should [set up a PostgreSQL server and configure OpenVoxDB to use it][configure_postgres]. You may also need to [adjust the maximum heap size][configure_heap].

You can change OpenVoxDB's database at any time while the service is shut down, but note that changing the database does not migrate OpenVoxDB's data, so the new database will be empty.

If your PostgreSQL node is on a separate server than OpenVoxDB, you should [configure an SSL connection][postgres_ssl], otherwise your database communication will happen in plaintext over the network. This can
be made much simpler by installing using the [OpenVoxDB module][module].

## Step 4: Start the OpenVoxDB service

If you _installed_ OpenVoxDB from source, you can start OpenVoxDB by running the following:

    sudo service puppetdb start

And if Puppet is installed, you can permanently enable OpenVoxDB by running:

    sudo puppet resource service puppetdb ensure=running enable=true

If you are running OpenVoxDB from source, you should start it as follows:

    # From the directory in which OpenVoxDB's source is stored:
    $ lein run services -c /path/to/config.ini

> OpenVoxDB is now fully functional and ready to receive catalogs and facts from any number of Puppet Servers.

## Finish: Connect Puppet to OpenVoxDB

[You should now configure your Puppet Server(s) to connect to OpenVoxDB](./connect_puppet_server.html).

If you use a standalone Puppet site, [you should configure every node to connect to OpenVoxDB](./connect_puppet_apply.html).
