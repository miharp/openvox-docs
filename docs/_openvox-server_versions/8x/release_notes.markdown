## OpenVox Server 8.16.0

Released September 8, 2026.

This is an enhancement and bug-fix release of OpenVox Server.

All bug fixes, new features and other changes are provided on the [project's GitHub release page](https://github.com/OpenVoxProject/openvox-server/releases/tag/8.16.0).

Notable changes in this release:

- The `openvox-server` package now requires `openvox-agent` 8.29.0 or later, so upgrading the server also upgrades the agent on the same host.

### Known Issues in 8.15.0

#### `resolv` times out when `/etc/resolv.conf` contains multiple IPv6 nameservers

The JRuby 9.4.15.0 upgrade included in this release updated the Ruby `resolv`
library to a newer version. This newer `resolv` version introduced a mismatch
where queries to IPv6 DNS servers are sent using compressed addresses (e.g.
`2001:db8::1`), while responses arrive from un-compressed addresses (e.g.
`2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:1`). This mis-match means that queries to IPv6 servers
are never seen as "answered" and the library returns an empty `[]` response
after waiting for 160 seconds.

This issue only occurs when `/etc/resolv.conf` is configured exclusively with
two or more IPv6 nameservers. For example:

```console
# cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Google Public DNS (IPv6)
nameserver 2001:4860:4860::8888
nameserver 2001:4860:4860::8844
```

This issue will affect modules that use the `Resolv` library to look up
DNS records, notably: `puppet-dnsquery`.

The following command can be used to test if an OpenVox Server is affected
by the issue:

```bash
/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ruby -rtimeout -rresolv -e 'Timeout.timeout(10) { puts Resolv::DNS.new.getaddresses("voxpupuli.org") }'
```

The command will take several seconds to run, as a JVM is launched, but should
print a list of DNS addresses to STDOUT:

```console
104.21.84.238
172.67.198.227
2606:4700:3035::ac43:c6e3
2606:4700:3035::6815:54ee
```

The command will print a `Timeout::Error` if the issue is present:

```bash
Timeout::Error: execution expired
  timeout at uri:classloader:/META-INF/jruby.home/lib/ruby/stdlib/timeout.rb:199
   <main> at -e:1
```

### Known Issues in 8.13.0

#### `jruby-openssl` 0.15.4 Fails to Parse EC Keys

The `openssl` JRuby library included in this release may fail to parse some PEM
files that previous versions were able to parse, resulting in errors such as:

```console
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'org.bouncycastle.asn1.ASN1Primitive org.bouncycastle.asn1.sec.ECPrivateKey.getParameters()'
```

Not all files are affected, the error seems to be triggered by specific patterns in
ASN.1 content.
