## File Content

The `file_content` endpoint returns the contents of the specified file.

## Find

Get a file.

    GET /puppet/v3/file_content/:mount_point/:name

The endpoint path includes a `:mount_point` which can be one of the following types:

- Custom file serving mounts as specified in `fileserver.conf` — see
  [configuring mount points](/openvox/8.x/config_file_fileserver.html).
- `modules/<MODULE>` — allows access to the `files` subdirectory of `<MODULE>` — see
  [file serving](/openvox/8.x/file_serving.html).
- `plugins` — merges the `lib` directory of every module together. Used for syncing plugins; not intended for
  general consumption. Per-module sub-paths cannot be specified.
- `pluginfacts` — merges the `facts.d` directory of every module together. Used for syncing external facts; not
  intended for general consumption. Per-module sub-paths cannot be specified.
- `tasks/<MODULE>` — allows access to files in the `tasks` subdirectory of `<MODULE>` — see
  [file serving](/openvox/8.x/file_serving.html).

`:name` is the path to the file within the `:mount_point` that is requested.

so no schema is applicable.
