[deprecated]: ./deprecated_features.html

The `ca.conf` file configures settings for the OpenVox Server Certificate Authority (CA) service. For an overview, see [OpenVox Server Configuration](./configuration.html).

> **Deprecation Note:** The `authorization-required` and `client-whitelist` settings are [deprecated][] in favor of authorization that is configured in the [new `auth.conf`][] file.

## Signing settings

The `allow-subject-alt-names` setting in the `certificate-authority` section enables you to sign certs with subject alternative names. It is false by default for security reasons, but can be enabled if you need
to sign certs with subject alternative names. `puppet cert sign` used to allow this via a flag, but `puppetserver ca sign` requires it to be configured in the config file.

The `allow-authorization-extensions` setting in the `certificate-authority` section enables you to sign certs with authorization extensions. It is false by default for security reasons, but can be enabled if
you know you need to sign certs this way. `puppet cert sign` used to allow this via a flag, but `puppetserver ca sign` requires it to be configued in the config file.

## Auto-renewal settings

The `allow-auto-renewal` setting in the `certificate-authority` section enables automatic renewal of agent certificates. It is false by default.
When enabled, the CA issues certificates to renewal-capable agents with the lifetime from the `auto-renewal-cert-ttl` setting instead of the `ca_ttl` value, and agents renew their certificates automatically before they expire.
The packaged `ca.conf` sets `auto-renewal-cert-ttl` to 60 days; when the setting is absent, the built-in default is 90 days. See [Renewing and regenerating certificates](certificate_renewal.html) for details.

The `certificate-authority` section also accepts a `ca-ttl` setting that controls the lifetime of newly signed certificates and takes precedence over the `ca_ttl` value in `puppet.conf`.

## Infrastructure CRL settings

OpenVox Server is able to create a separate CRL file containing only revocations of OpenVox infrastructure nodes. This behavior is turned off by default. To enable it, set `certificate-authority.enable-infra-crl`
to `true`.

## Status settings (deprecated)

The `certificate-status` setting in `ca.conf` provides [deprecated][] configuration options for access to the `certificate_status` and `certificate_statuses` HTTP endpoints. These endpoints allow certificates
to be signed, revoked, and deleted through HTTP requests, which provides full control over OpenVox's ability to securely authorize access. Therefore, you should **always** restrict access to `ca.conf`.

The `certificate-status` setting takes two parameters: `authorization-required` and `client-whitelist`. If `authorization-required` is set to `true` or not set, **and** `client-whitelist` is set to an empty
list or not set, OpenVox Server uses the [authorization methods][`trapperkeeper-authorization`] and [new `auth.conf`][] format to control access to the administration API endpoints.

- `authorization-required` determines whether a client certificate is required to access certificate status endpoints. If this parameter is set to `false`, all requests can access this API. If set to `true`,
  only the clients whose certificate names are included in the `client-whitelist` setting can access the admin API. If this parameter is not specified but the `client-whitelist` parameter is, this parameter's
  value defaults to `true`.
- `client-whitelist` contains a list of client certificate names that are whitelisted for access to the certificate status endpoints. OpenVox Server denies access to requests at these endpoints that do not
  present a valid client certificate named in this list.

## Example (Deprecated)

If you are using the deprecated authorization methods, follow this structure to configure `certificate_status` and `certificate_statuses` endpoint access in `ca.conf`, whitelisting a client named `host1`:

```text
certificate-authority: {
   # deprecated in favor of auth.conf
   certificate-status: {
       authorization-required: true
       client-whitelist: [host1]
   }
}
```
