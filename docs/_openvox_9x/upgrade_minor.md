title: "Upgrading OpenVox 9"
---

Use this page for routine OpenVox 9 upgrades and for in-place migrations from the
legacy Puppet packages to OpenVox packages.

> **OpenVox 9 is a major version** and includes breaking changes relative to OpenVox
> 8 — see [Upgrading from OpenVox 8 to 9](upgrade_major.html) and the
> [release notes](./release_notes.html) before upgrading a production host. The
> steps below cover the mechanics of the upgrade itself.

The main migration rule is that a host cannot have both Puppet and OpenVox packages
installed at the same time. Back up `/etc/puppetlabs/` before you start.

## Recommended order

Upgrade in this order:

1. `openvox-server`
2. `openvoxdb`
3. `openvoxdb-termini` on server nodes
4. `openvox-agent` on managed nodes

This keeps the central services ahead of the agents they serve. On a host that runs
more than one of these, upgrade all of its OpenVox packages in one package manager
transaction, as the commands below do. When upgrading from OpenVox 8 this is required:
the 8.x server and database packages require `openvox-agent` below 9.0.0 while the 9.x
packages require 9.0.0 or newer, so they cannot be upgraded one at a time.

## Upgrading Linux packages

If the host still has the `openvox8-release` package, it is subscribed to the 8.x
repository and the commands below leave it on 8.x. Install `openvox9-release` first;
the [upgrade guide](upgrade_major.html#test-then-upgrade) has the commands for each
platform.

On apt-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --only-upgrade openvox-server openvoxdb openvoxdb-termini openvox-agent
```

On yum-based systems:

```bash
sudo yum update openvox-server openvoxdb openvoxdb-termini openvox-agent
```

If you are migrating from Puppet packages rather than upgrading an existing OpenVox
install, enable the OpenVox repository first and then install the corresponding
`openvox*` packages. The package manager will replace the legacy Puppet packages.

## Upgrading Windows and macOS agents

On Windows and macOS, download the current `openvox-agent` installer for your
platform and run it again. OpenVox continues using the same configuration paths, so
you normally do not need to move configuration files by hand.

- [Install OpenVox agent on macOS](./install_osx.html)

## After the upgrade

After each stage:

1. Confirm services are running.
2. Run a test agent execution.
3. Check certificate handling and OpenVoxDB connectivity where applicable.
4. Review the [release notes](./release_notes.html) for version-specific changes.
